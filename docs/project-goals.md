Project Concept: Meowtivator
‚ÄúChoose the purrfect quote for every felineng.‚Äù

üß† Core Idea
Instead of randomly auto-matching an image with a quote, the site shows a cat image + a few AI-generated quotes. The user picks the best match. This makes the experience feel more like a game or creative process.
